URGENT
1. Catch this version up to the js version (This will be my main developed thing now, since I am moving off of js.)
2. Set up website / docs.
3. Update github repo.
4. Resetup discord-minecraft passthrough.

OPTIONAL
5. Create a custom readline package. (I Dont like the current one right now.)
6. Create a custom glob package ( The warning whenever I start a bot due to glob is annoying. )
7. Change some commands into context menus / ect.
8. Have the website update the mongoose database.
9. Custom reaction roles.
10. Custom "automod"
11. Custom music player.
12. Make a way to interaction with discord.


EXTREME PROJECTS
13. Replace external modules entirely (except discord.js and mineflayer)
14. (Probably not going to happen) Custom discord.js release (So I can have a custom one where I have control over changes.)
15. Make an api for the bot.
16. Create window for logs and stuff instead.
17. Add the ability to watch what the bot is watching in react.

COMPLETE :
Terminal updates.


Questions : [
    Why would I put 11 before 12 instead of afterwards. & Why not mineflayer.

    I feel like making an on site database & console coloring would be easier than making a thing on the discord api, expecially since it would need its own 
    revamp of all of the code.
