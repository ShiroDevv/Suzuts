<h1>Welcome to the suzu docs!<br></h1>

<h2><b>This bot is early in development! It doesnt have all features added into the bot yet!</b><br></h2>

<h2>If the code isnt working for you : </h2>
<p>
    Attempt to check these 3 things : <br>
    1 : Make sure you are using typescript<br>
    2 : Set typescript to be using the EMCA files instead of commonjs<br>
    3 : Make sure you are on the most up to date version.<br>
</p>

<p><b>This documentation might have code you cant access, since I am also documenting the code in the private version.<br>
The private version code will start with : <i>Warning : Code is on the private version, currently not available to the public!</i></b><br></p>

<p> About having almost no comments, I am just used to coding that way. This documentation is meant to be a way to make up for it.<br></p>

<h3 style="color: red;"> IF SOMETHING IS NOT DOCUMENTED, I EITHER HAVENT GOTTEN TO IT, OR IT IS CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT.<br></h1>

    <p>
        This is where you need to go if you are having development problems with things I added in.<br>

        To navigate around the docs, the sidebar will show you the functions that are currently documented.<br>

    <h2>About the bot<br></h2>
    <p>
        Suzu is the discord bot I am currently developing as a hobby project. Currently it has a decent amount of
        iterations :<br>
        Suzu.cpp - Discontinued due to lack of discord libraries that are easy for me to work with<br>
        Suzu.ts - Current bot, has a custom webpage made by me for docs unless the js one<br>
        Suzu.js - Sometimes in development, original, most up to date<br>

        Its a bot that I am trying to get to be all-purpose, just to make a single bot for people<br>
        I want to keep this bot opensource and with no paywalls. This might change at somepoint<br>
        I might take donations to the bot too<br>
    </p>

    <h2> Planned additions<br></h2>

    <p>
        I want to add an api to this bot for my networth conversions, and I want to create a dashboard.<br>
        The bot in the end should be able to do the majority of these : <br>
    <h3>Moderation commands</h3>
    <li>Ban</li>
    <li>Kick</li>
    <li>Mute</li>
    <li>Automod</li>
    <li>Warn</li>
    <li>Customizable punishments</li>
    
    <h3>
        Extra commands
    </h3>
    
    <li>Economy commands</li>
    <li>polls</li>
    <li>QOL commands</li>
