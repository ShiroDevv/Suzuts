# Suzu

### included compiled js if you wanted to work on that for some reason 

## The bot that attempts to do everything!

### NOTE : This version of the bot is really early in development. The only additions so far is the website, documentation, and the mineflayer bot.

## Suzu, but better

I wanted to move off of javascript to typescript, since it has types while still having the ability to set the type to any when I dont know the type for it

## Better website!
The old website was just a module that I downloaded, but this time the entire website is made from scratch. What that means is that I can make more pages than the base pages.
Docs are made, website experiments is something I can do, and I can make an api so you can use some of the things I can turn into an API!

### Note : The top navbar of the website acts wierd when the page is resized out of 1920x1080p, idk why, it just is that way.
If you know a way to fix it, please tell me!.

## Attempt to make the code more readable!
I decided this time to add some of the comments into the code, since I am used to not adding comments for some reason

## More modular!
If you are trying to develop with the bot, almost all functions in the code (outside of index.ts) are all exported! Only one function (which is wrapped by another function for people) is not exported!<br><br>
Documentation for the bot will be setup on replit (Heroku got rid of free dynos sadly) or when you start the bot at localhost:3000/docs.
