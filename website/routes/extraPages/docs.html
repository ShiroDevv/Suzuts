    <h1 id="top">Welcome to the suzu docs!</h1>

    <h2> This bot is really early in development.</h2>
    <h2> If the docs code is not working for you try using typescript, and setting it to compile to EMCA files.</h2>
    <h3> Sorry if this documentation is not that good, I never documented my stuff before.</h3>
    <p>
        About the code, sorry about not putting comments, I am just used to that. I use function names and variabled to make sure I know what I am doing, but I didnt think about other people developing with the bot. This documentation is supposed to be a way to assist you with development, instead of comments.
    </p>

    <h3 style="color: red;"> IF SOMETHING IS NOT DOCUMENTED, I EITHER HAVENT GOTTEN TO IT, OR IT IS CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT.</h1>

    <p>
        This is where you need to go if you are having development problems with things I added in.<br>

        To navigate around the docs, the sidebar will show you the functions that are currently documented.<br>

    <h2>About the bot</h2>
    <p>
        Suzu is the discord bot I am currently developing as a hobby project. Currently it has a decent amount of
        iterations :<br>
        Suzu.cpp - Discontinued due to lack of discord libraries that are easy for me to work with<br>
        Suzu.ts - Current bot, has a custom webpage made by me for docs unless the js one<br>
        Suzu.js - Sometimes in development, original, most up to date<br>

        Its a bot that I am trying to get to be all-purpose, just to make a single bot for people<br>
        I want to keep this bot opensource and with no paywalls. This might change at somepoint<br>
        I might take donations to the bot too<br>
    </p>

    <h2> Planned additions</h2>

    <p>
        I want to add an api to this bot for my networth conversions, and I want to create a dashboard.<br>
        The bot in the end should be able to do the majority of these : <br>
    <h3>Moderation commands</h3>
    <li>Ban</li>
    <li>Kick</li>
    <li>Mute</li>
    <li>Automod</li>
    <li>Warn</li>
    <li>Customizable punishments</li>

    <h3>
        Extra commands
    </h3>

    <li>Economy commands</li>
    <li>polls</li>
    <li>QOL commands</li>
    <li>A simple card game</li>
    <li>Hypixel skyblock related commands</li>
    <li>And more to come!</li>
