        Welcome to the Website for the bot! This is where I am going to store the docs and the features of the bot.
    </p>
    <h1>
        Dashboard

    <a href="/">Go to the dashboard!</a>
    <h2>
        Docs!
    </h2>
    <p>
        The docs will be updated as I add functions and stuff into the bot. It will show how I used the functions I made
        and extras.

    <h2>
        Features
    </h2>
    <p>
        The features are going to be updated as the bot goes along, but currently there is nothing in since the bot is
        in development right now.
